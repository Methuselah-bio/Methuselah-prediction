"""Test package for Methuselah prediction.

This package contains simple unit tests to verify that core modules
import correctly and basic functions return expected types.  The tests
are intentionally lightweight to allow continuous integration in
resourceâ€‘constrained environments.  Add new tests as you extend the
project.
